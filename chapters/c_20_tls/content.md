# TLS

A brief note about TLS.

SSL (secure socket layers) is deprecated. Use Transport Layer Security.

Latest version as of November 2025: TLS 1.3.

The certificates as based on __public key infrastructure__ (PKI) system conventions.

|Term | Used by | Technically Means
|-|-|-
|SSL Certificate | Common marketing term | An X.509 certificate used in TLS/HTTPS
| TLS Certificate | Technically precise term | Same certificate, used in modern TLS
| Digital Certificate / X.509 Certificate | Generic technical term | The underlying file structure, used in PKI systems

In other words, all SSL certificates are PKI certificates, but not all PKI certificates are SSL certificates.
